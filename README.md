F.E.E.T is an amazing project, powered by Monster, Black, Red Bull and Pizza.
We simply sat down with an idea of creating a game in one crazy night, and we did it.
We didn't have any experience with PyGame before, so let's call it a POC. And guess what, it works!

It's a simple recreation of a masterpiece - Sm≈çl Snek.
You can choose one of two board types:
 - 1: Bordered
 - 2: Unlimited

You can move with arrow keys or WSAD.
The aim is not to hit the wall, nor Your tail. Collect red boxes, AKA food to elongate the snek and gain points.
Once every 15 seconds You get a chance to eat a special tread, the golden box. It gives You 100 points.
